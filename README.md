# Data Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Data Analysis Dashboard is a web application built using Streamlit that allows users to upload a CSV file and perform various data analysis tasks. The dashboard provides functionalities for previewing the data, summarizing statistics, visualizing correlations through heatmaps, and generating scatter plots based on user-selected numerical columns.

## Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed. Then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. It's a good practice to create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To start the application, run the following command from your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Once the application is running, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the Data Analysis Dashboard.

1. Upload a CSV file using the upload button.
2. View the data preview and summary statistics.
3. Explore the correlation matrix and heatmap.
4. Select numeric columns to create scatter plots for visualization.

## Features
- **Data Upload**: Allows users to upload CSV files.
- **Data Preview**: Displays the first few rows of the uploaded data.
- **Summary Statistics**: Provides statistical summaries of the dataset.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Computes and displays the correlation coefficients between different variables.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualizes the correlation matrix as a heatmap.
- **Scatter Plot Visualization**: Enables users to select columns for scatter plotting.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python packages:
- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
